## TinyHuff: Huffman Compression Algorithm Implementation

This project presents an implementation of the Huffman Compression algorithm, crafted by GitHub user @swativ5. The project is structured into two components:

1. **Backend**: Utilizing Spring, the backend hosts REST APIs facilitating file compression and decompression employing the Huffman Compression algorithm developed by @swativ5. The REST API controllers are orchestrated by @octagonemusic.

2. **Frontend**: Developed with React.js, the frontend furnishes a user-friendly interface for uploading files to undergo compression or decompression. The frontend development is credited to @octagonemusic.

## Usage Guide

Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/octagonemusic/TinyHuff-App.git`.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd tinyhuff`.
2. Execute `mvn clean install` to build the project.
3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to launch the server.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd tinyhuff-frontend`.
2. Execute `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to initialize the React.js application.
